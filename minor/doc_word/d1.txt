A seed of hope is the beginning of every good thing in our lives. Hope gives birth to the overcoming life. It always believes for the best, even in the face of the worst circumstances. For believers in Christ, hope is much more than a wish, yearning or a positive outlook, it is based on the promises of God found in His Word. They are promises to move on your behalf.
